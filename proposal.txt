Coh-metrix 3.0 (http://tool.cohmetrix.com/) is an online tool which analyzes texts and returns over 200 indices of lexical competence, syntactic complexity, cohesion, etc. It is widely used in discourse analysis research, but the way the text characteristics are calculated may not suit the need of every researcher. In addition, there may be other textual features not included in Coh-metrix that people are interested in calculating with the help of a program.

In my case, I am interested in studying the features of spoken language in written text. I have been looking at the amount of direct speech used in a text (usually signaled by the use of double quotations around text) or the number of interjections (i.e., words such as Ouch, Oh my Goodness, Wow, Yikes). When looking for these words in the writing data, I had to manually count the frequency of occurrences which took a great amount of time. Therefore, I would like to develop a simplified version of Coh-metrix and include indices for the number of interjections and the proportion of direct speech.

For interjections, the program should be able to identify interjections by comparing words in a given text with a list of interjections stored in the computerâ€™s memory. Whenever the computer finds a word to be an interjection, it should add 1 to the count. The program may also be able to differentiate different types of interjections (e.g, first and secondary interjections) in a similar way. Next, to calculate the proportion of direct speech, the computer would have to find double quotation marks and other signaling phrases. It would have to differentiate direct speech from direct quotes which is used in written language and not necessarily related to spoken features of language in written form. Once the results are calculated, the program should put those results into a table and print it on screen as output.
